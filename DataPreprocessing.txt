spliting data set into training set and test set
need for this?
-ML-about a machine that is going to learn something in this case a model learing from
data to make predictions
-We have tp test it on a new dataset which is diffrent form training set on which 
we built out model
-performace on test set should be same as that on training set
-machine learning model users the x_train dataset to make correaltion btn dependent and
independent variables and once it has understood the correlation, test if the model can apply the correlation on the test data set.
- the better the model learns using the train data set the better predicting the test
data set
overfiting - regression-solve using regularisation technique.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

Feature scaling
-variable are not on the same scale
-this causes some issues in ML model
-ml models are based on euclidean distance
-need to transform values into the same scale
standardisation, normalisation
-dont need to apply F.s to classification (dependent variable)
